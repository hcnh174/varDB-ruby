<p class="introduction">
The following gene families were compiled based on literature searches, genome sequence projects, and Pfam profiles.
The definition of antigenic variation differs slightly between eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses.
In eukaryotic species we selected families consisting of multiple paralogous genes with coordinated control of expression.
In bacteria and viruses, we also include gene families that may include only one copy per individual but which participate in clonal variation.
